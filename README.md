- Jupyter notebook used for post-processing of laboratory data 
  - "YB_ExpAnalysis_V01.ipynb"  
  
- Excel file with the results for the lower wave heights
  -  YB2m_Tests_V6.xlsx

- Excel file with the results for the higher wave heights
  -  KB4m_Tests_V6.xlsx
  
  
## IMPORTANT NOTE
- The Excel files contain all the data needed to prepare the report.
- The time series included in the Excel files have been filtered as described in the Jupyter notebook.
- The zero of the time series data from the cameras is not the same as the other time series due to the absence of a trigger in the experiment.
